```

**Store Listing Title:**

```

## Steps to Fix & Get Re-reviewed

### 1. Wait for Internal Track Processing (5-30 minutes)

The version 4 build is currently being processed in the Internal Testing track. Google needs to process it before you can:

- Update the changelog
- Promote it to production
- Submit for review

### 2. Verify the Issue is Fixed

Check that the installed app name matches the store listing:

**What Google is checking:**

- ✅ App name displayed on device: Should be "Easy Baby Tracker"
- ✅ App icon: Should match the store listing icon
- ✅ Store listing title: "Easy Baby Tracker"

**To verify:**

1. Install the app from Internal Testing
2. Check the app name shown on your device's home screen
3. Compare with the store listing

### 3. Promote to Production (when ready)

Once version 4 is processed in Internal Testing and you've verified it:

```bash
# Option A: Manually promote in Play Console
# Go to: Play Console > Release > Internal testing > Version 1.0.2 > Promote to Production

# Option B: Use fastlane to promote
cd /Users/owner/source/baby-tracking-app/native-wind
fastlane android check_release_status  # Check current status first
```

### 4. Update Changelog for Version 4

Once version 4 appears in the Play Console, upload the changelog:

```bash
cd /Users/owner/source/baby-tracking-app/native-wind
fastlane android upload_metadata version_code:4
```

The changelog is already prepared at:
`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/4.txt`

### 5. Submit for Review

After promoting to production:

1. Go to the Play Console
2. Navigate to: **Release > Production**
3. You'll see the rejected version with an option to fix issues
4. Click **"Submit for review"** or **"Resubmit"**

## Additional Actions to Address the Issue

### Verify Screenshots Match the App

Make sure your Play Store screenshots show:

- The actual app name "Easy Baby Tracker" in the UI
- Current app design and features
- No misleading information

Screenshots location: `fastlane/screenshots/android/en-US/`

### Verify App Icon

Make sure the icon in your app matches the store listing:

- Check: `assets/images/icon.png`
- Ensure the adaptive icon also matches: `assets/images/adaptive-icon.png`

### If Issue Persists

If Google still rejects after these changes, check:

1. **App Display Name in AndroidManifest.xml**
   - Sometimes the name in the manifest differs from the store listing
   - This is auto-generated by Expo, but verify it matches "Easy Baby Tracker"

2. **Launcher Name**
   - Check if you have a custom launcher name that differs

3. **Screenshots**
   - Ensure all screenshots show "Easy Baby Tracker" as the app name
   - No outdated screenshots with different names

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check release status
fastlane android check_release_status

# Upload metadata (title, descriptions)
fastlane android upload_metadata skip_changelogs:true

# Upload metadata including changelog (after version is processed)
