# Browser Assistant (Comet) - Best Practices Guide

**Last Updated:** December 2024

This guide contains best practices for working with Comet as your browser assistant. Reference this document when you need to collaborate with the browser assistant for tasks.

---

## **1. Be Specific and Clear with Instructions**

**✅ Good:**

- "Check my Google Play app review status and tell me how long it usually takes"

- "Create a Gmail filter for Google Play emails and apply a label"

- "Find the testers section and verify the email address"

**❌ Avoid:**

- "Check my stuff"

- "Set up something"

- "Make it work"

---

## **2. Provide Context About Your Goals**

Tell me what you're trying to accomplish, not just what you want me to do.

**✅ Good:**

- "I need to monitor my app review so I don't miss critical updates. Can you set up a notification system?"

**❌ Avoid:**

- "Filter my emails"

---

## **3. Let Me See Pages First**

I work best when I explore the page structure first before taking actions. I'll use `read_page` or screenshots to understand what we're working with.

**✅ Good:**

- "Can you check why I'm not receiving test emails?" (I'll explore the page first)

**❌ Avoid:**

- Asking me to do things without giving me context about the page layout

---

## **4. Ask for Confirmations on Important Actions**

For sensitive operations, I'll ask for confirmation before proceeding:

**Examples where I'll ask:**

- Sending emails

- Making purchases

- Entering financial data

- Accepting terms/agreements

- Publishing or submitting forms

You can speed this up by saying: **"proceed without asking"** in your original request if you're ready.

---

## **5. Use Complete Instructions for Complex Tasks**

For multi-step tasks, you can either:

**Option A:** Give one instruction and let me do it step-by-step

- "Set up email filtering for Google Play notifications" (I'll create the label, then the filter)

**Option B:** Break it down if you have preferences

- "First create a label called 'App Reviews', then create a filter that stars and labels emails"

---

## **6. Monitor Your Browser Tabs**

I can work with multiple tabs at once. If you want me to:

- Compare information from different sources

- Open new tabs for research

- Switch between tabs

Just tell me: **"Open a new tab for..."** or **"Compare this with..."**

---

## **7. Trust the Process - I'm Thorough**

I won't stop mid-task or give you partial results. If I say "I'm checking..." I'll:

- Explore all relevant sections

- Complete the full task

- Give you a comprehensive summary

---

## **8. For Sensitive Information**

I protect your privacy:

- **I won't enter credit card numbers** - you must do this yourself

- **I won't log into accounts** - you log in, I navigate as you

- **I won't share sensitive data** - I handle it securely within this session

---

## **9. Ask Me to Search When Needed**

If you need current information, tell me:

- "Search for recent Google Play review timelines"

- "Find the official policy on..."

- "Look up best practices for..."

---

## **10. Real-Time Feedback**

If something doesn't look right, tell me immediately:

- "That's not the right button" - I'll adjust

- "I need it different" - Give me specifics

- "Wait, let me check something first" - I'll pause

---

## **Real Example from Today:**

When you asked about your app review, here's what worked well:

✅ **Your task:** "Check why I can't get email to test on device as I set the tester is my account"

- **What you did right:** Specific pain point + context about what you set up

- **Result:** I found the email address issue quickly

---

## **Quick Reference Checklist**

Before asking me to do something, verify:

- [ ] I understand your end goal (not just the action)

- [ ] The task is specific enough

- [ ] I have context about what page we're on

- [ ] For sensitive actions, you're ready to give permission

- [ ] You have confirmation ready (passwords, 2FA codes if needed)

---

## **Example of Best Practice Session**

**You:** "I want to track when my app gets approved by Google Play. Can you set up a system so I don't miss the notification?"

**Me:** (I explore Gmail and Google Play Console, then propose a solution)

**Solution:** Create label → Set up filter → Auto-star emails

**Result:** You get organized notifications without manual work
